## Harness

This repo uses Harness. Before work, read:

- `README.md`
- `docs/HARNESS.md`
- `docs/FEATURE_INTAKE.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/CONTEXT_RULES.md`
- `docs/TOOL_REGISTRY.md`
- `scripts/bin/harness-cli query matrix` on macOS/Linux, or `.\scripts\bin\harness-cli.exe query matrix` on Windows

Use the Rust Harness CLI at `scripts/bin/harness-cli` on macOS/Linux or
`scripts/bin/harness-cli.exe` on Windows as the main operational tool. Before a
step that could use an external tool, run `scripts/bin/harness-cli query tools
--capability <name> --status present` to see what is equipped; an absent
capability is a clean skip.

## Harness

Run `zharness --version`, then `zharness preflight <stage> [--mode <mode>] --json` for every workflow skill invocation. Follow a returned stop and recovery exactly.

Read `docs/WORKFLOW.md`, then only the returned stage playbook and repository material relevant to the requested outcome. Repository docs, code, tests, and observable behavior are authoritative; the database is a lifecycle ledger and recovery index.

Read-only and bounded work may use reduced mode and must not mutate harness state. Durable planning, full execution, full checks, and durable handoffs require an initialized database. Claim completion only with executable or observable evidence.
